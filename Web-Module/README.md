# What is this all about?

## The Curriculum system

We want to present you one of first steps we took to get rid of Canvas, as we have some issues with it. We hope you'll enjoy using new system.

One of great feature here is a search bar available on top of the sidebar on the left. We hope it will make it easier for you to get back to previous materials if you search for something.

Of course for now we'll have only materials for that single room here. If it will turn out to be a good Canvas replacement for you, we'll do our best to migrate materials from other rooms as well.

## Codecool Journey

There is also another, more powerful system that we're starting to use from now on - [Codecool Journey](http://journey.code.cool). You will find your self-assesment questions there, so be sure to register there.

When you register, you have to wait for mentor's approval - please contact one of mentors from your module to approve you. After being approved, please set your location and save. After that you'll be able to set your current module. Without it you would not be able to see self-assesment questions.

Please make sure all of your data is up-to-date in Journey - if you're currently on SI week, please mark it in your profile.

## Curriculum - sidebar

We're looking for the best way to make it easy to find relevant materials in our new system.

### Icons

We decided to use some emojis to represent type of content on the sidebar. Their meaning:

* :open_book: - content page
* :hammer: - assignment
* :heavy_plus_sign: - additional icon that will preceed any content that is not mandratory, but might be useful for those who want to learn more and more

### Links structure

We try to separate links on the sidebar in the way that is easy to read and navigate. However, it's hard for mentors to see from student's perspective, so if you have any idea of changing anything it, just contact us. We'll be glad to know how we can improve.
