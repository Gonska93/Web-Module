### In case something is still not clear...

It's really important to understand all the things listed above. If you still uncertain using some of the features, please try the following tutorials:

<https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/mac/introduction> (you can change between Desktop and Command line)

<https://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/>

In case you found anything not listed here, please let the others know about it in the relevant discussion.

Git's UI is not really self-explanatory, and it's hard to forget the commands. You can print and use the official cheat-sheet, whenever you need it:
