# Bootstrap (framework for front-end)

If you learned enough about HTML and CSS and know how to write HTML pages and format them with CSS then you know the basics of front-end development.

You can already start using front-end frameworks because they are out-of-the-box useful for your work.

We will start with Bootstrap, but good to know that there are other popular frameworks out there, like AngularJS, Material Design, Prototype JS

## Five reasons to use Bootstrap

Over the last few years Bootstrap has become an increasingly popular front-end development framework. More and more developers and designers continue to get on board. Evidently, there is a reason for that.

### 1\. Speed of Development

Undoubtedly one of the biggest advantages of using Bootstrap is the speed of development. If you're looking to push out a new website or application quickly, you should definitely consider using Bootstrap.

Rather than coding from scratch, Bootstrap enables you to utilize ready-made blocks of code to help you get started. Combine that with cross-browser compatibility and CSS-Less functionality, many hours of coding can be saved. To achieve the fastest route possible, you can also purchase complete Bootstrap themes and modify them to suit your needs.

#### 2\. Responsiveness

Mobile devices continue to grow in popularity year by year. Cisco predicts that global mobile data traffic [will increase nearly 11-fold](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/white_paper_c11-520862.html "Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013â€“2018") between 2013 and 2018. The need to have a responsive website is proportional to this.

#### 3\. Consistency

Bootstrap was actually founded on this principle. It was [originally developed](http://alistapart.com/article/building-twitter-bootstrap "Building Twitter Bootstrap") by a few Twitter employees as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Co-Founder Mark Otto later realized it had potential beyond just an internal toolkit and released the first open-source version in August 2011.

Mark also describes how Bootstrap was built using one core concept: pairing designers with developers. Doing so is what made Bootstrap successful at Twitter and the reason behind its continuous success on the web.

Put simply, Bootstrap ensures consistency regardless of who is working on the project. In addition, results are uniform across platforms so output remains the same whether you're using Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer.

#### 4\. Customizability

Bootstrap can be tailor-made according to the specifications of your project. Developers have the ability to pick and choose the features that are needed and the rest can be tossed. This is easily accomplished using the [Bootstrap customize](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ "Bootstrap customize") page. Simply tick off all the features you don't need and your custom version of Bootstrap will be ready to download. How cool is that?

#### 5\. Support

Bootstrap has a huge support community behind it so you can usually get help when you run into issues. Furthermore, Bootstrap itself is being continuously updated and the creators have been really good about putting out timely updates. It is currently being hosted, developed and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap "GitHub") with over 16,000 commits and over 900 contributors.

### Conclusion

As you can see, there are several benefits to using Bootstrap. The framework allows for rapid, responsive development that is consistent and well supported by the developer and designer community.

As the framework continues to develop, the reasons to use Bootstrap keep mounting. If you have overlooked this framework, it is probably time to give it a try.

  1. As a start we suggest to read the introduction which contains how to put Bootstrap into your HTML page: <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/>
  2. You can browse any css or js feature of Bootstrap, but make sure that you check the most used ones: 
    1. Grid system to easily make page layouts: <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/>
    2. Navbar: <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/>
    3. And other useful ones like [Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/), [Input Groups](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/), [Modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/)



To test your knowledge you can try to create a simple page with:

  * Navigation bar with a few menu points
  * Three columns below which are next to each other on larger screen and below each other on small screen
  * In every columns you can have a button and if they are clicked then a modal popup should come up
  * Nicely formatted footer
  * You can try to change the navigation bar and the footer to stay fixed even if there is vertical scrolling



To get some ideas you can check the official examples and the themes:
