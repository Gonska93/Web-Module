# Objectives of the 4th Self-instructed week in Web with Python (no OOP)

## Introduction

Wow! You're soon becoming experts in web, aren't you? You've mastered HTML and CSS, you saw the base syntax of javascript. But there's a chance you have the feeling, that something is still missing... Probably you already had the need to make your pages more dinamic and interactive. How about if you could do that from this week?

## This week's agenda

### JavaScript

We will dig deeper into this awesome language and make some fun with it by changing the HTML code dynamically responding to user actions like clicking buttons.

Creating a game you can test your JavaScript knowledge any your memory too.

### User Interface Design

**To maximize usability and user experience.** If we cannot create handsome and easily understandable interfaces, our end-users (clients and customers) cannot use them as intended and they will abandon the product causing obvious damages for the software company.

We're going to make steps in this topic so this week will hopefully have some effect on your source code and the appearance of your application as well.

### HTML/CSS with Bootstrap

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

We will learn some features of it this week.
