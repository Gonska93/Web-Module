# Assignment: Web with Python: First Web Server - Super Sprinter 3000 (no OOP)

## Story

Write an app to store your team's Agile development process through sprints and represent it to your client.

## Requirements

The web application should consist of 3 pages:

### Adding page [ _ **/story**_ ]

  * Empty form (there is no data in the inputs) with a "Create" button. It should create a new User Story.![super sprinter - add story-1.png](media/Web%20with%20Python%20module%20resources/super%20sprinter%20-%20add%20story-1.png)



### Editor page [ _ **/story/ <story_id>**_]

  * The same form as the create page, but filled in with data of the given User Story.
  * The "Update" button should update an existing entry, not create a new entry.

**Note:** To get a part of the URL and use it as a variable, Flask routes support the so called [variable rules](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#variable-rules).

### List page [ _ **/**_ and _**/list**_ ]

  * It should have a **HTML`<table>`** containing all the data.
  * In the end of every row, you should add a pen and a bin icon. Both should be links, the pen should redirect to the editing page of the given row and the bin icon should delete the given row.
  * Add an "Add a new User Story" button to the page. It should redirect to the (Creating) **/story** page.

### Persistence

The application should persist data using a .CSV file.

The list page displays a field, called "id", which is not entered by the user. This field should be generated by one of the following methods:

  1. Checking the saved csv file, get the last row and get the stored **id** value. Then add 1 to increase it and create a  unique **id**.
  2. Include the **uuid** library and use it to generate a UUID (long generated unique string). 



### Other requirements

  * You should create 2 [templates (Links to an external site.)](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/templates/): **form.html** and **list.html**
  * All the 3 pages should have a different title (use HTML **`<title>`** tag):
    * Super Sprinter 3000 (for the list page)
    * Super Sprinter 3000 \- Add new Story (for the **/story** page)
    * Super Sprinter 3000 - Edit Story (for the **/story/ <story_id>** page)
  * The input boxes should have some rules, you can find them in the wireframe images above
  * The **label** s of for the form inputs [shall be valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) **`<label>`** tags connected to the specific field. (With **"for"** attribute pointing to the **"id"** attribute of the related `<input>` or `<textarea>` tag.)
  * All input fields and buttons should have a specific **"id"** attribute.
  * The **Create** / **Update** button should submit the form to your server via a HTTP request. Only HTTP GET and POST requests are needed to perform the operations!



You **don't** have to use CSS!
