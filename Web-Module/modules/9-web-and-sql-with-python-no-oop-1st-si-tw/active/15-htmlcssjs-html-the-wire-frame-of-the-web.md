## <h1>Hello world</h1>

Probably you already met with these 3 fellows, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML describes the structure of the websites, CSS gives a nice styling to them (like fonts, paragraphs, colors,..) and JavaScript can perform client-side logic to do stuff (for example animated menus, video players, clickable maps,..).

Now, we will only take a look on HTML in this SI week.

**Read and do the tutorials in the following page:<http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/>**[LINK](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/)

Note: instead of the default text editor, you can use Atom/VS Code or PyCharm. They will just help. But please don't use any visual site creator. As the tutorial also warns about it, they usually add non-standard, hard to understand stuff into your code. Also you do not learn the most important part - how it works doing so. Professionals don't use Dreamweaver! ;)
