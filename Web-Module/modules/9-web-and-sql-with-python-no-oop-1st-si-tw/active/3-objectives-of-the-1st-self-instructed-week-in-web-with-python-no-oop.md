# Objectives of the 1st Self-Instructed week in Web with Python (no OOP)

## Where are we now

You now understand the basics of programming, and can write decent console applications using Python. 

## What's next (How this week will help me in my career)

During this week, you will gain basic knowledge about how the largest network, the "world wide web" works, by some theory and writing both a client and a server application.

Understanding how the web works is essential, even if you won't directly work with web sites. Almost all of the currently running applications in the world are connected to some kind of network.

A website on the internet is connected to the "www".  
All electronic-medical equipment are connected to their local and national system.  
Military systems are also connected to their own network.  
And today, even your doorbell or kitchen sink may be connected to a local "smart home" network.
