# The Waterfall project management method

## Introduction

The waterfall method is a sequential design process used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.

The waterfall development model originates in the manufacturing and construction industries: highly structured physical environments in which after-the-fact changes are prohibitively costly, if not impossible. Because no formal software development methodologies existed at the time, this hardware-oriented model was simply adapted for software development.

Please watch the following video about Waterfall, and excuse the creator for the shitty robot voice :-)

### Waterfall nowadays

In the past 10 years, waterfall model is used in less and less projects because of it's disadvantages. It's not a really good method for handling projects, where the requirements are not 100% clear, or where changes on the project's scope have to be handled regularly. Nonetheless it's still a really good way to implement a software, where the requirements are clear, the technology is understood and the project is short. You should have a basic understanding about this process for historical reasons and because it's still used at some companies.
