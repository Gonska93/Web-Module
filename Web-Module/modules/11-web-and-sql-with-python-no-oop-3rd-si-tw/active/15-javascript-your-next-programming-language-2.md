# JavaScript, Your next programming language

## Introduction

JavaScript (JS in short) is the missing tool you haven't used yet in the web-stack. It's a programming language invented for being able to run code in the browser (on the client-side), but nowadays it's widely used on the server-side as well. For now (at least) we'll stay using JS in the browsers...

## History and background

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possible - applications with which you can interact directly, without doing a page reload for every action. But it is also used in more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.

It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by marketing considerations, rather than good judgment. When JS was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.

After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work to make sure the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably - they are two names for the same language.

## Let's do some JS!

**Please read, understand, and try the examples from the Beginner part of following tutorial:**

<http://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/>

Also check:

  * The tutorial misses the **do..while** loop, check it out: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while)
  * The tutorial shows you function _expression_ , but there are also [function _declaration_](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp). They do **almost** the same thing, the main difference is the expression way is using a variable to hold the function. This means it will only work in the code running after the expression.  
Here in Codecool we recommend the declaration way when you create function in JavaScript.

## You can be sure you learnt the beginner level, if you can answer these questions:

  * Where should you put semicolons?
  * Can you declare a variable without a value? Why?
  * What happens if you add a number to a string? Whats the difference between JS's and Python's behaviour?
  * How many equlation signs should you use in JS for different purposes? What is the difference between Abstract Equality Comparison and Strict Equality Comparison?
  * Is variable comparison easy to understand in JS? Why not? :) 
  * How do we call lists in JS? What's the difference between the Python and JS versions?
  * How do we call dictionaries in JS? What's the difference between the Python and JS versions?
  * How can I write an if statement with 3 ways? (if this, then do A or if that, then do B otherwise to C)
  * What types of loops are available in JS? What is the difference between them?
  * There are multiple types of creating a function, what's the difference?
  * How can you find a value in an object by it's key? (there are 2 ways)
