# Assignment: Sprint plan for AskMate (part 3)

## New rules

From now on we would like to simulate the real business environment around a SCRUM project so the below rules will apply:

  * Team have to turn in a sprint plan before starting implementation (this assignment).
  * If after the acceptance test (TW live grading at Friday) the sum of business values of the accepted user stories are around half of the planned, it normally results in a value of 4 in Conform to requirements outcome. If it's more or less than half, then the points will shape proportionally.
  * **If during the sprint the team notifies the PO about not completing some planned stories, then around half of the business value is not deducted** , so we will calculate the value of the Conform to requirements outcome based on this modified planned value. Why around half? Because time is also important: if the team notifies the PO early (e.g. on the first implementation day) then the deduction can be as high as 75%, but if they notify the PO late (e.g. on the last implementation day before noon) then the deduction can be as low as 25%. **Notifications after the last implementation day noon doesn't count.**
  * **If the team's actual business value (after the acceptance test) is greater than the planned, they can only count these extra business value if they notified the PO** and they can only count with around half of these business values. Similarly then above: if they notify early, they can get more than half, if they notify lately they can less than half. **Notifications about extra stories after the last implementation day noon doesn't count as well.**
  * Notifications 
    * should be written,
    * should be done as comments to this assignment,
    * should be confirmed by the PO in written form (also comments to this assignment).



## Sprint plan assignment

You have to turn in a table describing the user stories of your sprint plan ("Python: AskMate project (part 3)" assignment):

  * The name of the user story (feature) copied from backlog
  * The business value of the user story (feature) copied from backlog
  * The description of the user story (feature) copied from backlog
  * The assigned story points of the user story (feature)



Please don't include user stories marked as "optional" or "if we have time". Try to make a precise plan instead, so include user stories into the plan what you estimate to be done at the end of the sprint. Of course, if during the sprint you think that your estimation is wrong, you can always reschedule and notify the PO about the change.

If you think that all of the user stories in the backlog (considering all three parts of this project) can be done in this sprint and you will have extra time, then you can suggest user stories to the PO, but these should be also notified and confirmed.

**The table to be turned in should be in .pdf format!** (You can easily export a Google Spreadsheet sheet into PDF)
