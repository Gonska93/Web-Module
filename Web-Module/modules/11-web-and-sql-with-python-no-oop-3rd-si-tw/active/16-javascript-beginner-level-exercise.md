# Assignment: Javascript - Beginner level exercise

## Overview

In this assignment, we'll do some school like exercises to practice the syntax of JavaScript.

## Do some Math!

Based on [this page](http://www.mathsisfun.com/area.html), we'll make a small tool to help elementary school students :)

  1. Checkout the base repo: <https://classroom.github.com/a/Gj9EW9R1>
  2. Create HTML files for each menu items.
  3. Create something similar to the line example in all pages.
  4. Calculate the area of each shapes, and write it like in the example.
  5. For the circle, also calculate and write out the circumference.



Notes:

  * In most pages, you will need to prompt/ask for multiple values to calculate. You can see on the page linked above (mathsisfun) which data you have to ask from the user to calculate the area (i.e. w=width, h=height for rectangle).
  * This exercise does not use a web server, which is a rare case in the real word. But for now, this should help you understand the difference between the code running on the server and the code running inside the browser.
