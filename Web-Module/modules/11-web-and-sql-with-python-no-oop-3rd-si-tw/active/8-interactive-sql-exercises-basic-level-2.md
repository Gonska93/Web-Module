Please solve these interactive (i.e. can run from browser) SQL exercises. These will help you practice your newly acquired SQL skills. You can click on the "Continue" button after finishing the tasks in a lesson but watch for the next lessons title as not all lessons are required to do for this week.

**Important: you can find a "Solution" link in each lesson with which you could easily reveal the solution. We strongly suggest to NOT use this link and to try to solve the exercises on your own in order to truly practice and learn this topic.**
