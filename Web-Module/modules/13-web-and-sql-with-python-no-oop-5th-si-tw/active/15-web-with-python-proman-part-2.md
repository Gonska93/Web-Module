# Assignment: Web with Python - ProMan (part 2)

## Description

The project continues, the 2nd sprint came with the ProMan (Trello clone) project.

The product backlog contains new items as seen in the spreadsheet below (you can implement items already in the backlog - you can see them in the last sprint's spreadsheet - but make sure to add items from the new ones as well (you can see which is the most important for the PO).

Watch out, to implement the user stories you have to use at least these technologies:

  * Postgresql
  * Heroku
  * AJAX
  * Session



See the separate assignment for submitting the sprint plan.

You can continue the git repository started last week.
