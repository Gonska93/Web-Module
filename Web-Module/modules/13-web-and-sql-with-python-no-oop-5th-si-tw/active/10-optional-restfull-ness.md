# [optional] RESTfull-ness

## RESTful-ness

_In computing, representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful is an architectural style used for web development. Systems and sites designed using this style aim for fast performance, reliability and the ability to scale (to grow and easily support extra users). To achieve these goals, developers work with reusable components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole while it is running. ... APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are called RESTful APIs._

**A very good introductory description about REST can be read[here](https://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction). Please read it as on the teamwork week you should use it to write proper RESTful API endpoints.**

Another [article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/understanding-rest-and-rpc-for-http-apis/) covers the difference between REST and another style, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), so it is easier to understand REST.
