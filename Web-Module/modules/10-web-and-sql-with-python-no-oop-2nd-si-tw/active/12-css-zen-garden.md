# Assignment: CSS Zen Garden

## Introduction

[CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/) is a beautiful and smart project and a web page which shows how can CSS alter a look of a HTML page in very different ways.

Look at the HTML source of the page and feel free to browse the different CSS designs applied to it (you can choose some from the left side of the page, but we encourage to look at the [full list](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/) as well to see how different design can be implemented - e.g. check out the designs named [Under the Sea!](http://www.csszengarden.com/213/) and [The Final Ending](http://www.csszengarden.com/136/)).

## The assignment

Your task is to create an alternative design to csszengarden.com. Of course you don't have to create such beautiful designs with lots of images and artwork, the purpose of the task is to practice the newly acquired CSS knowledge.

Please download the [HTML file](http://csszengarden.com/examples/index) but don't use the sample CSS file available for download at the page. Instead start from an empty .css file and create a design where you alter at least the following tags and ids:

  * body, p, h1, h2, h3, footer
  * #zen-intro, #zen-summary, #zen-preamble, #design-selection



Please use at least these properties while altering the design:

  * font-family, color, background-color, text-align
  * padding, margin, width, height, top, left
  * display, position



**Remember, the goal is to practice CSS, so we don't require you to spend tens of hours to create a wonderful design, but if you want to, you can unleash your inner creativity dragon just make sure you do that after everything else :)**

Put both of the files into a github repository and submit the https URL (without the .git part).
