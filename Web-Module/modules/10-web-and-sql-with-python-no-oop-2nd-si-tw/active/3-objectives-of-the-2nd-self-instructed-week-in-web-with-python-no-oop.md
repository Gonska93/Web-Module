# Objectives of the 2nd Self-instructed week in Web with Python (no OOP)

## This week's material

On this week we will dive into two further topics. On one hand we will discover databases as a fundamentally different approach to data storage and management compared to files. On the other hand we will learn a further topic in Web development, which is about the style and look of web pages, namely CSS.

**Databases and SQL** are inherent part of almost every programmer's job, you will definitely meet with some kind of databases in your future programmer job, so it is the time and place to make the foundations of that knowledge.

Knowing **CSS** is an essential part of a [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) developer's work, knowing the basics is helpful to everyone as it belongs to "everyday IT knowledge". Of course, who are interested in this topic, can dive into it deeper later on.

  * Introduction to SQL basics (ETC ~5 hours)
