# Assignment: DOJO - Javascript code taboo

Hurray, it is a pair programming code taboo :)

  * Please form pairs first and turn to face each other
  * One of you can open the first algorithm and try to explain to the other who must open a code editor and try to implement the algorithm that the other explains
  * Please do not read up the algorithm word by word and focus on using proper tech language
  * After the first round you can change roles and explain/implement the other algorithm



First algorithm: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GXr8Nglu6B1oyTecK4xXx1FcM7Z7x0K7qAbxVg468rc/edit?usp=sharing>

Second algorithm: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUkLDAWjsDnpjdxbpgtph3xBa8iXBd7YNadNsjbIxTw/edit?usp=sharing>
