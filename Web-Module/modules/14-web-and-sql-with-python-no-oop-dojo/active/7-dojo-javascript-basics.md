# Assignment: Dojo - Javascript basics

Javascript is full of adventure! You can achieve the same result in many different ways and it's sometimes hard to figure out how to start.

In the following game, you gonna finish up some missing parts of code blocks to help the hero find the exit. But, it's not a set of Coding Katas or exercises. You won't be asked to write full algorithms, but to kick the code until it runs as expected. It won't be clean and won't be nice. It's gonna be fun anyways ;)

Now, travel to the far away land of [Untrusted](https://codecoolbase.github.io/javascript-workshop---untrusted/) and beat the levels alone or in a pair!
