# Dojo: AJAX

Do these exercises in order to practice

  * DOM manipulation,
  * event handlers,
  * callback functions and
  * reading API documentation.



You can implement all the exercises in one HTML page with separate JavaScript files per exercise.

**1\. Current time**

Create a button and a paragraph tag. Clicking the button should change the text of the paragraph tag to the current time. Don't trust your computer's time, instead of that use an API. You can use [this](https://timezonedb.com/api) one, it's free to register, you will get an API key which you have to include in every request. Read the documentation to figure out, how to use the API.

**2\. Weather by city**

Create a drop down list with some cities (include at least 5 different one - you can pick your favourite ones :) ) and create a table. Changing the value of the drop down list should change the table to show the weather data (temperature, sky conditions, humidity) of the chosen city. You can use this [API](https://openweathermap.org/api), you don't even have to use an API key.

**3\. City information**

Extend the previous exercise to show not your favourite cities but create a simple input field with autocomplete feature (so when the user starts typing, a list of cities appear which matches that search). You can use [this](https://developers.teleport.org/api/getting_started/#search_name) API for the source of cities and you can use jQueryUI for [autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/).
